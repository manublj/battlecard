1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Purpose of This Document
This document serves as the comprehensive blueprint of Zoomout, outlining its conceptual
foundation, structural methodology, and technical execution.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

7

Unlike traditional news aggregators that simply store events, Zoomout is a dialectical
contradiction-tracking intelligence system that reveals the underlying power struggles,
ideological shifts, and historical continuities behind political events.
This document will:
Explain Zoomout‚Äôs transition from a simple event tracker to a class struggle
intelligence engine.
Detail how contradictions are structured and tracked dialectically rather than in a
static manner.
Showcase how Zoomout differs from traditional fact-checking or event-reporting
tools.

Zoomout‚Äôs Core Goals
Revealing contradictions in political events rather than just recording them.
Tracking ideological shifts dynamically instead of storing static stance data.
Mapping power structures through entities, contradictions, and stance shifts.
Providing predictive intelligence based on contradiction escalation trends.
Zoomout does not present neutral facts‚Äîit maps power struggles.

1.2 Evolution of Zoomout: From Battlecard V1 to a
Dialectical Intelligence System
Zoomout did not start as a contradiction-tracking intelligence engine. It originally began
as Battlecard V1, a basic tracking tool for political events, ideological positions, and
theoretical references.
While Battlecard V1 allowed for manual documentation of political developments, it did
not provide a dialectical structure for understanding contradictions. Over time, the
limitations of linear event tracking led to the development of Zoomout.

1.2.1 Origins: Battlecard V1 as a Political Tracking Tool
Battlecard V1 was originally built as a spreadsheet-based system to track:
Political Events ‚Üí Logged as individual occurrences.
Entities ‚Üí Political parties, figures, and organizations, along with their stances.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

8

Theoretical References ‚Üí Links to Marxist, Leninist, and Maoist analyses relevant to
ongoing struggles.
Battlecard V1 did not track contradictions dynamically. Events were listed in isolation,
and entities were tagged with ideological positions rather than being analyzed for stance
evolution over time.

Limitations of Battlecard V1
Events lacked relational structuring.
Example: A labor protest and a government crackdown would be recorded
separately, with no way to analyze how they sharpened the Capital vs. Labor
contradiction.
No systematic contradiction tracking.
Example: The State vs. People contradiction was not explicitly structured. Events
of state repression were simply tagged as ‚Äúgovernment actions‚Äù rather than mapped
onto an evolving contradiction.
Entities were treated statically.
Example: Political parties were recorded only in terms of current positions, with
no way to track ideological shifts over time.

üî• These limitations led to the transition from Battlecard V1 to Zoomout, transforming
a passive tracking tool into an active contradiction-mapping intelligence system.

1.2.2 The Transformation of Zoomout: From News Aggregation to
Contradiction Tracking
Zoomout is NOT an event aggregator. Unlike mainstream media tracking systems that
simply record occurrences, Zoomout maps contradictions between class forces, state
power, and ideological narratives.
This transformation was necessary because:
News aggregators fragment political reality.
Instead of showing contradictions, they present events as isolated, unconnected
incidents.
Fact-checking models neutralize contradictions.
Instead of analyzing power struggles, they reduce everything to binary ‚Äútrue or
false‚Äù classifications.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

9

Liberal media frameworks obscure class struggle.
Instead of exposing contradictions, they create false narratives of ‚Äúneutrality.‚Äù

Key Differences Between Battlecard V1 and Zoomout
Battlecard V1

Zoomout Intelligence System

Events recorded in isolation.

Events are structured within evolving
contradictions.

Entities are listed with ideological positions.

Entities are tracked for stance shifts over time.

No system for tracking how contradictions escalate or
neutralize.

Contradictions are mapped dynamically over
time.

No relationship tracking between contradictions.

Contradictions are stacked and linked across
struggles.

üî• Zoomout is NOT a passive database‚Äîit is a system that structures class
contradictions dynamically.

1.3 Why Zoomout Exists: The Ideological and Practical
Necessity
Mainstream news reports events in isolation‚Äîcreating the illusion that political struggles are
disconnected. This is not just an accident; it is a deliberate ruling-class strategy to prevent
revolutionary consciousness from forming.
By tracking contradictions, Zoomout exposes ruling-class distortions and reveals historical
continuities in class struggle.

1.3.1 The Ruling Class Uses News to Suppress Contradictions
Contradictions cannot be hidden forever, but they can be manipulated through ruling-class
ideological control.
Fragmentation of Political Narratives
The media presents strikes, riots, elections, and uprisings as separate events, rather
than connecting them to long-term class contradictions.
Avoidance of Structural Contradictions
Instead of exposing systemic inequalities, the media focuses on individual scandals
and sensationalism.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

10

Manufactured Consensus
Liberal media creates false debates to distract from actual contradictions (e.g.,
focusing on ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù instead of class oppression).
Example:
Instead of analyzing the corporate control of agriculture, mainstream news focuses
on the personal lives of protest leaders.
Instead of exposing how capitalists exploit crises, media narratives focus on blaming
marginalized communities.

üî• Zoomout directly counters this by ensuring that contradictions are tracked
historically, materially, and ideologically.

1.3.2 Why Tracking Contradictions is Essential for Political Intelligence
Without contradiction tracking, political analysis remains superficial and incapable of
predicting ruling-class maneuvers.
Zoomout ensures that:
Contradictions are not erased.
Political struggles are mapped as part of long-term historical trends.
State repression and ideological distortions are accounted for in tracking.
Example:
The sharpening of contradictions before elections
In many countries, state repression intensifies before elections, but mainstream
media treats this as isolated events rather than a recurring pattern.
Contradictions in ideological framing
Ruling-class narratives shift depending on context. A movement framed as
"radical" today may be reframed as "legitimate" later, based on ruling-class
interests.

üî• Without contradiction tracking, political actors are forced into reaction rather than
strategic action.

1.4 Zoomout‚Äôs Revolutionary Purpose: How It Differs from
Traditional News Aggregators

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

11

Zoomout does not exist to document history passively‚Äîit exists to provide revolutionary
intelligence by mapping contradictions in real time.
Unlike traditional news sources, Zoomout is structured to:
Expose hidden contradictions.
Reveal ideological shifts.
Predict ruling-class countermeasures.
Ensure that class struggle is understood as an evolving historical process.

1.4.1 The Failure of Traditional News & Fact-Checking Models
Traditional News

Zoomout Intelligence System

Records events in isolation

Captures contradictions between entities and forces.

Presents neutral headlines

Surfaces contradictions in ruling-class narratives.

Reports "breaking news" reactively

Anticipates contradiction escalation trends.

Ignores ideological shifts

Tracks how entities shift positions over time.

Example:
A protest movement may be ignored until it becomes mainstream, at which point it
is either neutralized or co-opted.
Political figures may be framed as "radicals" at one stage and "moderates" later,
depending on how contradictions develop.
Traditional news treats these shifts as random, while Zoomout tracks them as dialectical
developments.

1.4.2 Final Purpose of Zoomout: A Revolutionary Intelligence System
Zoomout is not just an archive‚Äîit is a weapon in class struggle.
It ensures that:
Contradictions are mapped, not erased.
Political struggles are tracked across historical time periods.
Class struggle is understood in motion, not as static events.

üî• "To fight the ruling-class intelligence machine, we must build our own."
project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

12

üî• The Dialectical Engine is the core of Zoomout‚Äîwhere contradictions are structured,
tracked, and analyzed dialectically.
üî• This section explains how contradictions evolve dynamically, how they are mapped
onto political reality, and how their intensity, resolution, or transformation is tracked
over time.

2.1 Materialist Ontology: Structuring Political Reality
2.1.1 Introduction
Zoomout‚Äôs structuring intelligence is built on Materialist Ontology, a framework that ensures
all political developments, struggles, and contradictions are analyzed based on their material
conditions rather than abstract ideological representations. This methodology moves beyond
simple event tracking and instead structures political evolution through a dialectical
framework, where contradictions are the driving force of historical and political motion.
Materialist Ontology ensures that:
Contradictions drive political evolution.
Struggles emerge as expressions of contradictions in motion.
Structures provide the material basis for contradictions.
Contradictions and struggles manifest through real-world developments, requiring
systematic tracking.
By structuring data this way, Zoomout moves beyond event-based analysis and instead
provides a historically grounded, materialist framework for understanding political motion.

2.1.2 Core Elements of Materialist Ontology

üèóÔ∏è Structures ‚Üí The Material Basis of Contradictions

Structures define the underlying economic, political, and social systems that shape
contradictions. They are the material foundation from which struggles emerge.

üìå Example: The capitalist economic system creates the Capital vs. Labor contradiction.
üìå Example: The caste hierarchy generates caste-based contradictions.

‚öñÔ∏è Contradictions ‚Üí The Fundamental Conflicts in Society

Contradictions are the opposing social forces in struggle. These conflicts evolve through
historical motion, either sharpening or being neutralized by ruling-class intervention.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

13

üìå Example: The contradiction between Feudal Landowners vs. Peasants intensified
during the land reform movements.
üìå Example: The National Liberation vs. Colonial Rule contradiction defined anticolonial struggles.

‚öîÔ∏è Struggles ‚Üí The Active Battle Over Contradictions

Struggles emerge as organized movements to either reinforce or challenge contradictions.
These struggles can take economic, political, or cultural forms and are classified by scale
(Local, National, Global).

üìå Example: The Dalit Panther movement fought against caste oppression.
üìå Example: The Russian Revolution was a struggle that overthrew capitalist structures.

üìÖ Events & Issue Cards ‚Üí Tracking the Motion of Contradictions

Events are the core unit of analysis, tracking how contradictions develop over time. Some
events remain isolated, while others form an event timeline, requiring structured tracking
through Issue Cards.

üìå Example: A workers‚Äô strike can be a single event or part of a larger movement tracked
through an Issue Card.
üìå Example: A constitutional amendment can signal ruling-class intervention in a
contradiction.

üèõÔ∏è Entities ‚Üí The Political Forces in Motion

Entities are the political actors shaping contradictions and struggles. They can be
governments, movements, unions, corporations, or parties.
Entities take stances through events, revealing their political position within
contradictions.
They are not static‚Äîentities can shift positions, betray movements, or become absorbed
by ruling-class structures.

üìå Example: A ruling party shifting its position on land reforms reflects an entity
responding to a contradiction.
üìå Example: A workers‚Äô union refusing to support a general strike can signal cooptation.

‚è≥ Timelines ‚Üí Tracking Contradictions Across History
project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

14

Timelines map contradictions over historical periods, ensuring that contradictions and
struggles are analyzed in motion, not as frozen snapshots.
There are two primary types of timelines:

üìä Event Timelines ‚Üí Track how a specific event develops over time (updates linked
via parent_id & update_id).
‚öñÔ∏è Contradiction Timelines ‚Üí Track how a contradiction intensifies, transforms, or
is suppressed over long historical periods.

üìå Example: The History of Agrarian Reforms can be structured as a Contradiction
Timeline, mapping how ruling-class policies have neutralized or sharpened land
struggles over decades.

üî• By structuring contradictions, struggles, and ruling-class interventions through
these six elements, Zoomout ensures historical tracking remains materialist and
dynamic.

2.1.3 Shift from Event Tracking to Contradiction Structuring
The framework operates on the premise that historical motion is best analyzed through
contradictions rather than isolated events. Events are still recorded, but they serve as data
points within contradiction motion tracking, rather than as standalone units of analysis.
This shift ensures that all events are contextualized within the material forces driving their
emergence, sharpening, or resolution.
Contradictions are tracked dynamically, linking them explicitly to structures, struggles, and
entities to maintain analytical rigor. This eliminates the previous limitations of event-centric
tracking, which often led to fragmented or decontextualized narratives.
To implement this, events are assessed based on their relationship to contradictions,
categorized through:
Sharpening ‚Äì The event intensifies an existing contradiction.
Neutralization ‚Äì The contradiction is actively contained or defused.
Transformation ‚Äì The contradiction shifts in nature or is subsumed into a broader
struggle.
This ensures that all recorded events are functionally analyzed as part of historical processes,
rather than being passively logged as static occurrences.

2.1.4 Materialist Ontology in Action

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

15

Example 1: The NEET Protest (2021)

üìå Before (Event Ontology):

NEET Protest is categorized as a Protest Event.
It is linked to other protests in an Event Timeline.

üìå After (Materialist Ontology):
‚úÖ
Structure: Brahminical Control Over Education.
‚úÖ
Contradiction: Dominant Caste vs. Oppressed Caste.
‚úÖ
Struggle: Fight for Educational Access.
‚úÖ

Event: NEET Protest 2021 ‚Üí Issue Card tracks legal battles, government responses, and
media distortions.

Example 2: CAA-NRC Resistance

üìå Before (Event Ontology):

The Shaheen Bagh Protest was categorized as a Sit-in Protest Event.

üìå After (Materialist Ontology):
‚úÖ
Structure: Hindutva Supremacy & State Surveillance.
‚úÖ
Contradiction: Religious Nationalism vs. Secular Citizenship.
‚úÖ
Struggle: Fight Against Citizenship Discrimination.
‚úÖ

Event: Shaheen Bagh Protest ‚Üí Issue Card tracks arrests, police actions, and Supreme Court
rulings.
This restructuring ensures that contradictions drive analysis, not just event categories.

2.1.5 The Shift From Event Tracking to Contradiction Structuring

‚úÖ Developments are not isolated incidents‚Äîthey are part of larger contradictions in
motion.
‚úÖ
Political evolution is mapped by tracking how contradictions sharpen, neutralize, or

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

16

transform over time.

‚úÖ

Narrative distortions are analyzed based on ruling-class responses to contradictions.
This means that when a user looks at a protest, law, riot, or policy change in Zoomout, they
aren‚Äôt just seeing an occurrence‚Äîthey are seeing how it fits into a materialist contradictiontracking framework.

2.1.6 Operation: Node Backfill
Introduction
Contradiction tracking is only as strong as the depth and accuracy of historical mapping.
Operation: Node Backfill is an ongoing process in Zoomout that systematically strengthens
contradiction, entity, struggle, and structural tracking by integrating historical and
missing developments. This ensures that contradictions are tracked across their full trajectory
rather than just through recent occurrences.
By continuously integrating backfilled contradictions, past struggles, omitted events, and
structural shifts, Zoomout ensures that historical erasure by the ruling class is actively
countered while contradiction analysis remains materially grounded. Unlike passive event
tracking, Node Backfill reconstructs missing connections to prevent gaps in historical
materialist analysis.

Purpose of Node Backfill

üìå Expanding Historical Tracking
Adds historical developments that shaped current contradictions, struggles, and
structures.
Prevents the illusion that contradictions or struggles emerged spontaneously by mapping
their historical buildup.
Example: A present-day land struggle is backfilled with past evictions, legal battles, and
policy shifts that shaped it.

üìå Refining Structural Contradiction Analysis

Ensures that material structures generating contradictions are fully mapped, not just
their present manifestations.
Expands documentation of past struggles, policies, and economic shifts that were
suppressed or overlooked.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

17

Example: Backfilling caste-based land struggles from the 1950s to track how the
Dominant Caste vs. Oppressed Caste contradiction intensified over time.

üìå Strengthening Contradiction Motion & Entity Tracking

Prevents gaps in contradiction development, entity positions, and structural changes
by ensuring sharpening, neutralization, and transformation are fully recorded.
Example: A labor union crackdown in 1990 is backfilled to show how it connects to
modern anti-union policies, tracking the Capital vs. Labor contradiction and rulingclass response mechanisms over decades.
Example: An entity‚Äôs past political alliances are backfilled to reveal historical shifts in
its ideological stance.

Node Backfill as a Systematic Process
Unlike one-time historical documentation, Node Backfill is an ongoing and active process
that applies to:

‚úÖ Contradictions ‚Äì Ensuring their historical trajectory is complete, avoiding artificial
truncation.
‚úÖ Entities ‚Äì Mapping past alliances, ideological shifts, and policy stances rather than
isolating them to recent events.
‚úÖ Struggles ‚Äì Expanding struggle timelines by incorporating historical actions leading to
the present phase.
‚úÖ Structures ‚Äì Tracking structural transformations over time to reflect their evolving role
in shaping contradictions.
üöÄ With Node Backfill, Zoomout ensures that contradiction and entity tracking remain
historically rigorous, preventing the erasure of revolutionary struggles while refining
the materialist analysis of motion over time.

2.1.7 Conclusion: What This Means for Zoomout

üöÄ Materialist Ontology transforms Zoomout from an event-based system into a
contradiction-driven intelligence framework.
üöÄ
Instead of just documenting events, Zoomout now structures data based on
contradictions, struggles, and political evolution.

üöÄ

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

Users engage with a system that helps them analyze contradictions in motion rather
than treating political struggles as isolated occurrences.

üî• With this ontology in place, every section of Zoomout‚ÄîEvents, Struggles,

Structures, and Contradictions‚Äînow integrates into a unified materialist intelligence
system.

2.2 CONTRADICTION STRUCTURING &
RELATIONSHIP MAPPING
Why Contradictions Must Be Structured Dialectically
Contradictions do not remain static‚Äîthey evolve over time based on class struggle,
ideological shifts, and ruling-class countermeasures.
If contradictions are not systematically tracked, political analysis becomes:

‚ùå Fragmented ‚Üí Events appear disconnected rather than part of an ongoing struggle.
‚ùå Superficial ‚Üí The focus remains on individual actors rather than the contradictions that
shape them.
‚ùå Reactive ‚Üí Without contradiction structuring, analysts can only respond to crises
instead of anticipating them.

Zoomout‚Äôs Contradiction Structuring Model enables users to track:
How contradictions intensify or weaken over time.
How contradictions relate to political actors, movements, and ruling-class strategies.
How contradictions shift in ideological framing depending on historical conditions.

üî• Without contradiction structuring, political intelligence remains incomplete.
2.2.1 The Three Forms of Contradiction Evolution
Contradictions do not remain at a fixed intensity‚Äîthey change based on:
Escalation of struggle
State intervention
Changes in mass consciousness

1. Sharpening
The contradiction intensifies, leading to heightened political struggle.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

19

Example: Labor strikes escalate into factory occupations as workers radicalize.

2. Neutralization
The contradiction is temporarily suppressed through reform, state repression, or
ideological co-option.
Example: A government introduces minor labor reforms to prevent an uprising.

3. Transformation
The contradiction changes form, merging into new struggles or shifting terrain.
Example: A caste-based struggle transforms into an anti-capitalist movement as
class consciousness develops.

üî• Contradictions are never static‚Äîthey develop through material struggle.

2.2.2 Power Mapping: How Contradictions Shape Alliances and
Conflicts
Contradictions do not exist in the abstract. They shape political forces, alliances, and
conflicts in real-time. Power Mapping in Zoomout ensures that these alliances and conflicts
are structured within contradiction motion tracking, preventing surface-level analysis of
political shifts.
Zoomout tracks:
Who benefits from the contradiction.
Who opposes the contradiction.
Who remains silent (passive alignment).
How alliances shift as contradictions sharpen, neutralize, or transform.

How Power Mapping Works in Contradiction Structuring

üìå Example: Capital vs. Labor Contradiction

Sharpening ‚Üí Workers begin mass strikes, intensifying the contradiction.
Power Mapping ‚Üí The ruling party aligns with capitalists, deploying police against
workers.
Ruling-Class Countermove ‚Üí Corporate media shifts the narrative, branding the strike
as an ‚Äúanti-national movement.‚Äù

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

20

Neutralization Attempt ‚Üí The government introduces temporary wage reforms to
pacify demands.

üî• Power Mapping allows users to see not just the contradiction, but how it plays out
among political actors over time‚Äîexposing the forces behind every realignment.

üìå Key Insight: Alliances are not random‚Äîthey emerge only in response to contradiction
motion.

Ruling-Class Management of Contradictions in Power Mapping
The ruling class constantly seeks to control, suppress, or distort contradictions by
constructing alliances that neutralize emerging struggles.

üîπ Legal Containment ‚Üí The ruling class builds legislative alliances to pass laws that
suppress struggles (e.g., anti-protest laws).
üîπ Co-optation & Narrative Distortion ‚Üí Media alliances neutralize contradictions by
redefining struggles (e.g., branding labor strikes as ‚Äúforeign-funded movements‚Äù).
üîπ Repressive Coalitions ‚Üí The state mobilizes security forces, right-wing militias, or
corporate groups to directly suppress contradictions.
üöÄ Power Mapping ensures that all alliances, conflicts, and political realignments are
structured within contradiction motion, preventing surface-level analysis.

2.2.3 Stance Evolution Tracking
Why Stance Evolution Must Be Tracked
Political actors do not hold the same stance forever. As contradictions develop, their positions
shift‚Äîsometimes subtly, sometimes dramatically.
Zoomout ensures that:

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

21

Stance shifts are recorded over time instead of being treated as fixed positions.
Political realignments and ideological transformations are mapped.
Users can analyze past stance shifts to predict future ideological movements.
Example: The Indian National Congress (INC) on Economic Policy
1991 ‚Üí Supports neoliberal reforms (privatization, deregulation).
2019 ‚Üí Criticizes extreme neoliberal policies due to rising inequality.
2024 (Hypothetical) ‚Üí Attempts to adopt a populist economic stance.

üî• Tracking stance shifts reveals patterns of ideological movement rather than treating
entities as static.

2.2.4 Contradiction Stacking: How Contradictions Reinforce Each
Other
Why Contradictions Must Be Stacked
Contradictions do not operate in isolation‚Äîthey interact and reinforce each other over
time.
Zoomout allows contradictions to be:
Stacked on events ‚Üí Showing how multiple contradictions influence a single event.
Analyzed for intersectionality ‚Üí Mapping how caste, class, gender, and nationalism
contradictions overlap.
Tracked across struggles ‚Üí Some contradictions resurface in different historical
contexts.

Example of Contradiction Stacking
Event: A factory fires Dalit workers during a labor strike.
Capital vs. Labor Contradiction ‚Üí The workers are fired due to economic
exploitation.
Dominant Caste vs. Oppressed Caste Contradiction ‚Üí Dalit workers are
disproportionately affected, showing caste-based discrimination in labor struggles.
State vs. People Contradiction ‚Üí The police side with factory owners, suppressing
resistance.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

22

üî• Contradiction stacking allows users to see the full complexity of political struggles
rather than viewing them through a single lens.

2.3 Contradiction Threshold Engine
2.3.1 Introduction
Zoomout's Contradiction Threshold Engine determines when a contradiction intensifies to
a level where it demands strategic attention. Rather than relying solely on event frequency or
media coverage, the engine applies Materialist Ontology to measure contradiction
sharpening based on struggles, structures, and political motion.
Key Principles of the Contradiction Threshold Engine:

‚úÖ
Contradictions are dynamic‚Äîthey intensify or resolve based on material conditions.
‚úÖ Struggles serve as the primary indicator of contradiction sharpening.
‚úÖ Events are manifestations of contradictions in motion but are not the primary unit of
analysis.
‚úÖ Ruling-class distortions can obscure contradictions, but the engine ensures they are
surfaced through structured tracking.

The Contradiction Threshold Engine ensures Zoomout doesn‚Äôt just track what is
happening (events) but instead focuses on why it is happening (contradictions in motion).

2.3.2 Measuring Contradiction Intensification
To determine when a contradiction reaches a critical threshold, Zoomout uses a weighted
system that evaluates the following key factors:
Struggle Escalation
Are protests, strikes, or legal battles intensifying?
Are new social forces entering the struggle?
Are there signs of mass mobilization?
Example: The Capital vs. Labor contradiction sharpens when a wage struggle
escalates into a nationwide general strike.
Structural Shifts
Has the ruling class introduced new policies to contain or advance contradictions?
Are material conditions shifting in a way that impacts the struggle?

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

23

Example: The Dominant Caste vs. Oppressed Caste contradiction sharpens when
the state attempts to dilute reservation policies through legal loopholes.
Political Motion & Realignments
Are major political parties or organizations taking decisive stances?
Has the state escalated repression or co-optation?
Are contradictions becoming central to electoral or mass politics?
Example: The Hindutva vs. Secularism contradiction sharpens when a state
government imposes religious laws that provoke mass resistance.
Ruling-Class Distortions
Is media attempting to suppress or misrepresent the contradiction?
Are think tanks or elite institutions producing counter-narratives?
Has state propaganda intensified around the contradiction?
Example: The Fight for Land Rights contradiction is sharpened when corporate
media reframes land dispossession as "development."

2.3.3 Contradiction Validation System
To ensure contradictions are surfaced at the right time, Zoomout employs a Three-Layer
Validation System:
1. Event Accumulation
Contradictions require multiple corroborating events before being surfaced.
A single protest, strike, or act of repression may indicate a developing
contradiction, but it does not immediately qualify unless it is part of an ongoing
pattern.
2. Struggle Tracking & Stacking
Contradictions are validated based on sustained struggle over time.
Struggles are mapped across Issue Cards and Contradiction Stacking, ensuring
patterns of intensification are identified.
3. Cross-Validation with Structural Shifts
Before a contradiction reaches threshold status, it is checked against material shifts
(policy changes, economic trends, ruling-class interventions).

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

24

This system ensures contradictions are surfaced strategically, not reactively, allowing
Zoomout to track historical motion rather than isolated incidents.

2.3.4 Contradiction Threshold Levels
Zoomout categorizes contradictions into four levels of intensity, allowing users to track their
motion dynamically.

This system ensures that contradictions are analyzed dynamically rather than treated as
fixed categories.

2.3.5 Tracking Contradictions in Motion

1Ô∏è‚É£ Auto-Detecting Contradictions in Events

Zoomout integrates an auto-detection system to identify contradictions involved in an event
based on event types and past contradiction-event mappings. The system suggests
contradictions that apply to an event and allows users to confirm or adjust them.

How It Works:
1. Event Type ‚Üí Contradiction Matching:
Events are categorized based on historical contradiction patterns.
Example:
Minimum wage protests ‚Üí Capital vs. Labor contradiction
Indigenous land defense actions ‚Üí Colonial vs. Indigenous contradiction
Electoral coups ‚Üí Bourgeois Democracy vs. Popular Sovereignty
contradiction
2. Historical Mappings Influence Predictions:

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

25

Past events linked to contradictions improve future contradiction detection.
The system refines predictions based on historical contradictions from similar
events.
3. User Confirmation & Override:
Users can confirm, adjust, or manually assign contradictions to events.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Tracking Contradictions Over Time

Contradictions are not static‚Äîthey evolve through stages of motion. Zoomout tracks these
shifts dynamically:

üìå Example: Capital vs. Labor Contradiction

Latent: Economic stagnation, wages low but no mass struggle.
Developing: Isolated labor strikes, early unionization efforts.
Sharp: General strikes, national labor uprisings.
Explosive: Workers' insurrections, dual power emerging.
By embedding contradiction motion tracking in event timelines, Issue Cards, and Struggle
Sheets, Zoomout ensures contradictions are analyzed in historical motion, not as static
classifications.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Contradiction Logging for Long-Term Analysis

Each contradiction is logged in relation to past and present developments to detect trends:

‚úÖ Which contradictions are intensifying?
‚úÖ Which contradictions are being neutralized or transformed?
‚úÖ What strategies are forces using to manage or escalate contradictions?

This allows Zoomout to anticipate shifts in political struggle based on contradiction
movement.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Future Features: Contradiction Visualization
üìå Planned Feature (Not Yet Implemented):

Graphical representation of contradiction motion across multiple issues and struggles.
Allows users to track contradiction sharpening, neutralization, and transformation in realtime.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

26

Will integrate with the Principal Contradiction Tracker to highlight dominant
contradictions at any given moment.

2.3.6 Principal Contradiction Tracking & Logging
At any given historical moment, one contradiction stands as the principal contradiction,
meaning that resolving it is key to advancing struggle. Identifying and tracking the principal
contradiction ensures that revolutionary strategy remains focused on the most decisive battle
at any time.
Without principal contradiction tracking, struggles may become fragmented, directionless, or
vulnerable to ruling-class distortions. Zoomout‚Äôs Principal Contradiction Tracker allows
users to log and analyze the contradiction that dominates a given period, ensuring
contradictions are prioritized based on their historical impact rather than treated as parallel,
unrelated conflicts.

üìå Why Principal Contradiction Tracking is Necessary

‚úÖ Guides Political Strategy ‚Üí Recognizing the principal contradiction helps focus efforts
on the most decisive struggle at any given time.
‚úÖ Prevents Fragmented Analysis ‚Üí Instead of treating every contradiction as equally
significant, Zoomout ensures that contradictions are weighted based on historical importance.
‚úÖ Reveals Patterns of Struggle ‚Üí By tracking shifts in principal contradictions over time,
users can analyze how ruling-class forces and revolutionary movements adapt to changing
conditions.

‚úÖ Provides Historical Continuity ‚Üí Allows comparisons across different political
moments to understand how past contradictions were resolved, suppressed, or transformed.
‚úÖ Tracks Justifications and Trends ‚Üí Users must justify their selection of the principal
contradiction through predefined categories, ensuring historical rigor and consistency.

üìå How Principal Contradictions Are Logged

1Ô∏è‚É£ Users select the principal contradiction for a specific period ‚Üí This could be a day,
month, or year, depending on how quickly contradictions are sharpening or neutralizing.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Selection must be justified ‚Üí Users must provide a rationale under one or more of the
following categories:
üìÖ Recent Events ‚Üí The contradiction is dominant due to current political or economic
developments (e.g., mass protests, state repression, electoral realignments).

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

27

üìú Historical Context ‚Üí The contradiction has shaped long-term historical motion, and all
other contradictions flow from it.
üìä Data & Reports ‚Üí Statistical or documentary evidence shows that this contradiction is
the determining force in political conditions.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Principal contradictions are stored and reviewed historically ‚Üí Users can track how
different contradictions became principal at different times and compare historical trends.
üîπ Logged contradictions include a hierarchy of contradictions ‚Üí While one

contradiction is principal, other contradictions remain active and can be tracked in relation to
it.

üìå Interaction with Other Contradictions

While one contradiction may be principal, other contradictions remain active. However, their
resolution depends on resolving the principal contradiction first.

üí° Example: India‚Äôs Farmers‚Äô Protests (2020-21)
üî∫ Principal Contradiction: Capital vs. Labor (Corporate Agrarian Capital vs. Peasant
Workers).
üîª Subordinate Contradictions:
State vs. People (police repression).
Caste vs. Oppressed Castes (Dalit laborers disproportionately affected).
Private Capital vs. State Control (corporate agriculture policies).

üöÄ In this case, the struggle for agrarian labor rights is the central contradiction, while issues
of caste oppression and state repression are embedded within it.
üí° Example: The Indian Emergency (1975-77)
üî∫ Principal Contradiction: State vs. People (authoritarian repression).
üîª Subordinate Contradictions:
Capital vs. Labor (workers‚Äô rights under state suppression).
Caste vs. Oppressed Castes (increased caste violence under weakened democratic
structures).

üìå Tracking Principal Contradictions Over Time

While one contradiction may be principal at a given moment, contradictions evolve based on
economic shifts, political crises, and mass movements. Zoomout logs principal contradictions

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

28

over time, allowing users to analyze how different contradictions take precedence based on
historical motion.

üìå Users will be able to:

Compare past and present principal contradictions to study historical shifts.
Track how contradictions escalate or de-escalate over time.
Identify moments of crisis when contradictions sharpen into revolutionary or
counterrevolutionary struggles.
Examine how ruling-class forces attempt to suppress or shift the principal contradiction
to weaken resistance.

üí° Example: The Indian Emergency (1975-77)
üî∫ Principal Contradiction: State vs. People (authoritarian repression).
üîª Subordinate Contradictions:
Capital vs. Labor (workers‚Äô rights under state suppression).

Caste vs. Oppressed Castes (increased caste violence under weakened democratic
structures).

üí° Example: India‚Äôs Farmers‚Äô Protests (2020-21)
üî∫ Principal Contradiction: Capital vs. Labor (Corporate Agrarian Capital vs. Peasant
Workers).
üîª Subordinate Contradictions:
State vs. People (police repression).
Caste vs. Oppressed Castes (Dalit laborers disproportionately affected).
Private Capital vs. State Control (corporate agriculture policies).
These historical examples demonstrate how contradictions shift and interact over time,
shaping both state repression and resistance strategies.

üìå Impact on Revolutionary Analysis

Tracking the principal contradiction over time provides a scientific basis for revolutionary
strategy by identifying the decisive struggle at each stage of historical development.

üìå Key insights include:

Understanding how contradictions are neutralized or sharpened ‚Üí What factors lead
to contradictions becoming explosive?

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

29

Revolutionary vs. Counterrevolutionary Dynamics ‚Üí How does the ruling class
attempt to shift contradictions to undermine struggle?
Strategic Lessons for the Present ‚Üí How can past contradictions inform present
struggles?
By systematically tracking the principal contradiction, Zoomout allows for a dialectical
approach to historical analysis, ensuring that struggles are understood in their proper
materialist context.

üìå Future Expansion: Principal Contradiction Trend Analysis

üîπ Over time, Zoomout will visualize how principal contradictions shift across multiple
issues, struggles, and historical periods.
üîπ Users will be able to compare past and present principal contradictions to understand
patterns of struggle.
üîπ Future updates will include user challenges to principal contradiction selections,
allowing for dialectical debate over historical assessments.

2.3.7 Conclusion: The Role of the Contradiction Threshold Engine in
Zoomout

üöÄ Zoomout does not passively document political events‚Äîit tracks contradiction
intensification based on materialist analysis.
üöÄ The Contradiction Threshold Engine ensures that users see the deeper forces driving
political motion, rather than just surface-level occurrences.
üöÄ By integrating struggles, structures, and ruling-class distortions into contradiction
analysis, Zoomout provides an unparalleled tool for political intelligence.
üî• With this system in place, contradiction tracking becomes a revolutionary tool
rather than a simple reporting mechanism.

Final Thoughts on the Contradiction Threshold Engine
The Contradiction Threshold Engine is a crucial safeguard within Zoomout, ensuring that
contradiction tracking is:
Rooted in material analysis rather than subjective interpretation.
Filtered for ideological distortions and ruling-class distractions.
Developed dynamically through accumulating historical evidence.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

30

By enforcing strict validation mechanisms, the engine prevents contradictions from being
prematurely surfaced or erased, ensuring that Zoomout remains an uncompromising
revolutionary intelligence system for mapping political reality.

2.4 MATERIAL UNITY VS. IDEOLOGY
Why Contradictions Must Be Differentiated Between
Material and Ideological Forms

üö® Contradictions exist in both material reality and ideological representation.
However, ruling-class forces distort contradictions through ideological narratives to:
Suppress class struggle.
Reframe contradictions to serve ruling-class interests.
Divide oppressed groups to prevent revolutionary unity.

üî• Zoomout differentiates between contradictions arising from material conditions and
contradictions shaped by ruling-class ideological control.

2.4.1 How Material Contradictions Develop in Objective Reality
Material contradictions emerge from real economic, political, and social conditions rather
than from abstract debates.

Examples of Material Contradictions
Capital vs. Labor ‚Üí Wage suppression, layoffs, automation replacing workers.
State vs. People ‚Üí State violence, repression of dissent, mass surveillance.
Dominant Caste vs. Oppressed Caste ‚Üí Caste-based oppression in workplaces, land
distribution, and social mobility.
Material contradictions are not created by ideology‚Äîthey exist regardless of how they are
framed.

üî• Material contradictions persist even when ideological distortions attempt to erase
them.

2.4.2 How the Ruling Class Uses Ideology to Manipulate Contradictions

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

31

While contradictions exist materially, the ruling class distorts them through ideological
narratives.

Common Ruling-Class Ideological Manipulations
1. Reframing Contradictions as Non-Issues
Example: Unemployment is framed as "a result of laziness" instead of a structural
failure of capitalism.
Example: Caste oppression is framed as "cultural tradition" rather than systemic
exploitation.

2. Turning Class Struggles into Identity Conflicts
Example: The ruling class promotes nationalism to prevent workers from uniting
across borders.
Example: Caste struggles are framed as "social disputes" rather than economic
oppression.

3. Co-opting Oppositional Movements
Example: Corporate sponsorship of feminist movements while continuing labor
exploitation of women.
Example: Greenwashing environmental struggles while corporations continue
ecological destruction.

üî• By manipulating contradictions ideologically, the ruling class suppresses
revolutionary potential.

2.4.3 Tracking Ideological Distortions in Zoomout
To expose ruling-class ideological manipulation, Zoomout tracks:
How contradictions are framed in media narratives.
How political actors shift positions based on ideological battles.
How ideological distortions are used to neutralize contradictions.

Example: How Media Frames Contradictions Differently
Material Contradiction

How Media Frames It

Workers demand higher wages.

"Businesses are struggling due to wage demands."

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

32

Protests against police brutality.

"Unrest threatens national security."

Caste-based violence in rural India.

"A local dispute, not systemic oppression."

üî• Zoomout records these distortions, ensuring that contradictions are exposed rather
than erased.

2.4.4 Material vs. Ideological Resolution of Contradictions
Contradictions can be temporarily neutralized ideologically, but they can only be fully
resolved materially.
Resolution Type

How It Happens

Example

Ideological
Neutralization

The contradiction is hidden through

structural change or revolutionary
struggle.

Capitalism is overthrown, abolishing
the Capital vs. Labor contradiction.

üî• Only material resolution leads to the actual transformation of contradictions.
2.5 TIMELINE ENGINE: POWER STRUGGLE OVER
TIME
Why Contradictions Must Be Tracked Across Time

üö® Contradictions are not static‚Äîthey sharpen, neutralize, or transform over historical
periods.

Without tracking contradictions over time:
Ruling-class narratives erase past struggles.
Movements appear disconnected rather than part of an ongoing historical process.
The recurrence of contradictions is not recognized, making revolutionary forces
reactive instead of proactive.

üî• Zoomout‚Äôs Timeline Engine ensures contradictions are mapped historically, exposing
how struggles evolve, re-emerge, and shape political reality.

2.5.1 Contradiction Escalation vs. Resolution Trends
Contradiction resolution trends are tracked by analyzing how contradictions transition
between their four stages: Latent, Developing, Sharp, and Explosive. When contradictions

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

33

escalate, struggles become more acute, with sharper polarization and intensified political
stakes. Conversely, contradictions may be neutralized or absorbed through co-optation,
suppression, or shifts in the material basis.
Zoomout captures these shifts by linking events to contradiction motion tracking, ensuring
that both escalation and resolution trends are explicitly analyzed rather than assumed as
linear progressions.

2.5.2 Multi-Timeline Assignment
Events, struggles, and contradictions frequently unfold across multiple timelines. Instead of
forcing a singular classification, Zoomout allows for multi-timeline assignment‚Äîensuring
that key developments are contextualized within all relevant historical and structural
processes.
A single event might simultaneously be part of a localized labor struggle timeline, a
broader national political crisis, and a long-term economic transformation. This layered
approach prevents artificial segmentation of interconnected movements while maintaining
analytical clarity.

2.5.3 - Timeline Mapping for Prediction
Timeline mapping enables structured analysis of past patterns to anticipate potential
developments. By mapping how contradictions have historically escalated or resolved,
Zoomout allows users to compare current contradictions to similar historical cases.
Prediction in Zoomout is not deterministic‚Äîit does not claim absolute foresight but instead
highlights possible trajectories based on historical trends, ruling-class responses, and
struggle dynamics.
Events and contradictions are linked within historically materialist trajectories, allowing
users to analyze whether a contradiction is likely to sharpen, neutralize, or transform based on
historical motion and material conditions.

3. DATA MODEL & STRUCTURING
INTELLIGENCE
Why Data Structuring is Critical for Political Intelligence

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

34

üö® Contradictions must be structured systematically for analysis, tracking, and
prediction.

Without a structured data model:
Contradictions remain abstract instead of being mapped onto real-world events.
Historical struggles appear disconnected instead of being part of an evolving
pattern.
Political forces cannot be analyzed for stance evolution and realignments.

üî• Zoomout‚Äôs data model ensures that contradictions are dynamically tracked,
historically contextualized, and strategically analyzed.

3.1 Core Components of Zoomout‚Äôs Data Model
3.1.1 Introduction
Zoomout‚Äôs data model is structured using Materialist Ontology, ensuring that contradictions,
struggles, structures, and events are interconnected within a scientific, historical framework.
The goal is to provide a dynamic, contradiction-driven model rather than a static, eventbased database.
The data model is built around the following core components:

‚úÖ Events: Real-world manifestations of contradictions in motion.
‚úÖ Issue Cards: Structured tracking of developments within an event.
‚úÖ Struggles: Ongoing battles that shape and are shaped by contradictions.
‚úÖ Structures: Deep-rooted material systems that generate contradictions.
‚úÖ Contradictions: The core conflicts that drive political evolution.
By structuring data in this way, Zoomout ensures that every event, struggle, and structure is
analyzed within a broader contradiction-tracking system.

3.1.2 Key Data Entities in Zoomout
The following table defines the core data entities in Zoomout, explaining their role in
tracking contradictions, struggles, and historical motion.

and Contradictions, ensuring that all
contradiction tracking remains rooted
in material developments.

Issue Cards

A structured grouping of events that
require deeper tracking. They contain an
event timeline and a three-column
stance model for tracking ideological
shifts.
A collection of Issues that represent
ongoing battles over contradictions.

Struggles

Struggles are categorized by scale (local,
national, global), form (electoral,
direct action, armed struggle), and
sector (economic, political, cultural).

Structures

Contradictions

Issue Cards ensure contradictions are
analyzed dynamically rather than as
isolated events, allowing for
structured historical tracking.
Struggles are composed of Issues but
do not directly link to core elements
(Events, Entities, Structures, and
Contradictions). Instead, Events serve
as the primary linking mechanism.

The material foundations of society,
including economic systems, state

(e.g., Capital vs. Labor, Feudal Landlords
vs. Peasants). Contradictions shape

Ruling-class responses (Repression,
Narrative Manipulation, Cooptation) are logged through
contradiction-linked events.

üèõÔ∏è Entities
‚è≥ Timelines

The political actors involved in
contradictions and struggles. Includes
governments, unions, political parties,
ruling-class institutions, and social
movements.
Historical motion-tracking tools that map
contradictions and struggles over time.
Includes Event Timelines (tracking
event evolution) and Contradiction
Timelines (tracking contradiction
evolution).

Entities reveal their positions
through events, influencing how
contradictions sharpen, neutralize, or
transform over time.

Ensures contradictions are tracked
in historical motion, preventing static
analysis of struggles.

These seven entities ensure that Zoomout remains a materialist contradiction-tracking
system rather than a passive event-logging tool.

3.1.3 The Role of Issue Cards in Contradiction Tracking

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

36

Issue Cards serve as a structured method for tracking contradictions as they develop through
events. Rather than treating contradictions as static entities, Issue Cards dynamically capture
the motion of contradictions by structuring key events, stances, and contextual developments
within a coherent framework.
Each Issue Card is generated when an event reaches a level of significance that demands
deeper tracking. These cards function as dialectical wikis, updating in real time as new
events unfold.

Capturing Contradiction Motion through Issue Cards
Contradictions evolve through distinct motion categories:
Sharpening ‚Äì When struggles intensify and stakes escalate.
Neutralizing ‚Äì When contradictions are contained, either through suppression or
structural adjustments.
Transforming ‚Äì When contradictions evolve into new contradictions or fundamentally
shift in nature.
Issue Cards log events within contradiction motion tracking, ensuring that contradiction
shifts are not just noted but actively contextualized.

Tracking Ruling-Class Responses to Contradictions
Ruling-class interventions shape how contradictions develop. Instead of treating these
responses as isolated factors, Issue Cards track ruling-class actions as part of
contradiction motion itself. These responses fall into four primary categories:
1. Legal Containment ‚Äì Laws, policies, and judicial actions designed to limit the scope of
a contradiction.
2. Repressive Control ‚Äì Direct force, surveillance, and state repression deployed to
suppress contradictions.
3. Narrative Manipulation ‚Äì Ideological mechanisms used to reframe contradictions in
favor of dominant interests.
4. Co-optation ‚Äì Absorbing opposition demands into the system while neutralizing their
radical potential.
By tracking contradictions through Issue Cards, Zoomout ensures that contradictions are
not just passively logged but actively analyzed as they evolve in response to material
conditions and ruling-class interventions.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

37

3.1.4 How Events, Struggles, and Contradictions Interconnect
Zoomout tracks historical motion by structuring events, struggles, and contradictions
dialectically. Instead of treating these elements as isolated categories, Zoomout ensures they
are mapped dynamically, revealing how contradictions evolve over time and how political
forces interact within them.

üìå Events as the Core Linking Unit

‚ùå Misconception: Struggles, contradictions, and structures exist independently of events.
‚úÖ Reality: Events drive historical motion and are the only element directly linking to:
üèõÔ∏è Entities ‚Üí Political actors involved in struggles and contradictions.
‚è≥ Timelines ‚Üí How struggles and contradictions develop over time.
‚öîÔ∏è Struggles ‚Üí The broader battles that events are part of.
üèóÔ∏è Structures ‚Üí The material basis influencing the event.
‚öñÔ∏è Contradictions ‚Üí The fundamental conflict driving the event.
By structuring relationships this way, contradictions and struggles remain rooted in material
developments rather than static classifications.

üìå
Struggles Are Composed of Issues, But Events Are the Key Linking
Point
Struggles do not function as independent entities in Zoomout. Instead, they are composed of
issues, ensuring that struggles are mapped through real, event-driven developments rather
than abstract listings.
Struggles group related Issues together, forming structured historical narratives.
Events, however, are what directly link to other elements (Entities, Timelines,
Structures, Contradictions).

üìå Example: The Global Fight Against Neoliberalism is a struggle, but its actual

developments are tracked through specific events, such as anti-austerity protests, state
crackdowns, and electoral shifts.

üìå Entities & Timelines as Core Elements

Entities and timelines are crucial in contradiction tracking because they ensure that political
motion is contextualized historically rather than treated as isolated instances.

üèõÔ∏è Entities ‚Üí The political forces involved in contradictions and struggles.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

38

Entities take stances through events, influencing how contradictions intensify or
neutralize over time.
They are tracked dynamically, meaning their roles can shift based on historical
developments.

‚è≥ Timelines ‚Üí Ensure contradictions and struggles are analyzed over long historical
periods.

Event Timelines track how a specific event develops over time.
Contradiction Timelines track how a contradiction intensifies, transforms, or is
suppressed across different struggles.

üìå Example: The Struggle Against Colonial Rule in India is not just a list of resistance

movements. Instead, it is mapped across Event Timelines (key uprisings, repressive laws)
and Contradiction Timelines (colonial economic policies vs. indigenous industries over
decades).

üìå Issue Cards as a Structuring Mechanism

Issue Cards ensure that events are placed within their historical motion rather than being
recorded as standalone occurrences. Each Issue Card explicitly includes:

üìå Structures Involved ‚Äì Listing the material basis influencing the contradiction (e.g.,
capitalist labor markets, state repression apparatus, financial institutions).
üìå Struggles Linked ‚Äì Connecting events to broader political movements (e.g., labor strikes
linking to class struggle, student protests linking to democratic movements).
üìå Principal Contradiction (Optional) ‚Äì Allowing users to tag an issue with the most
significant contradiction shaping the event‚Äôs development at that moment.

These attributes ensure that Issue Cards do not merely document events but actively track the
motion of contradictions through struggle.

üöÄ This system ensures that every event is analyzed as part of a broader materialist
contradiction structure.

3.1.5 The Shift from Event-Based Analysis to Contradiction-Driven
Intelligence
Old Event-Based Model
Events were treated as isolated incidents.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

New Contradiction-Driven Model
Events are structured within contradictions and
struggles.

39

Event timelines were the primary focus.

Contradictions in motion define event significance.

Issue tracking was secondary.

Issue Cards structure struggle evolution.

No systematic way to track ruling-class
distortions.

Ruling-class distortions are mapped within Issue
Cards.

üî• This shift makes Zoomout a revolutionary intelligence system rather than just an
event database.

3.1.6 Conclusion: Why This Data Model Makes Zoomout Revolutionary

üöÄ Materialist Ontology ensures that data is structured based on contradictions, not
just events.
üöÄ Struggles, structures, and contradictions interact dynamically, providing real
political intelligence.
üöÄ Issue Cards act as the connective tissue between events and political motion,
preventing fragmented analysis.
üî• With this system in place, Zoomout is not just tracking history‚Äîit‚Äôs structuring
political evolution.

3.2 Event Structuring in the Database
3.2.1 Introduction
Developments in Zoomout are structured as manifestations of contradictions in motion,
ensuring that political motion is analyzed through contradiction sharpening,
neutralization, or transformation rather than isolated occurrences.
Unlike conventional event-tracking databases, Zoomout structures developments within
historical materialist ontology, ensuring that they are systematically linked to
contradictions, struggles, and structural conditions.
Core Principles of Development Structuring in Zoomout:

‚úÖ Developments are categorized based on their relationship to contradictions, not just
by type.
‚úÖ Issue Cards provide structured tracking of contradictions as they evolve over time.
‚úÖ Developments are linked to struggles, revealing their role in long-term political
motion.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

40

‚úÖ Narrative distortions, ruling-class responses, and ideological shifts are systematically
tracked.

By structuring developments in this way, Zoomout ensures that contradiction motion
remains central, preventing fragmentation in historical analysis.

3.2.1.1 Contradiction Motion vs. Sequential Timelines
In Zoomout, contradiction motion tracking replaces conventional timeline-based analysis.
Understanding this distinction is essential for effective contradiction tracking.
1. Contradiction Motion Tracking:
Captures how contradictions intensify, neutralize, or transform over historical
periods.
Focuses on the root material forces shaping developments rather than the sequence
of occurrences.
Example: "Capital vs. Labor" contradiction is tracked through labor strikes, union
crackdowns, and wage struggles, rather than simply listing a timeline of protests.
2. Event Timelines:
These remain available for tracking specific developments within contradictions but
are secondary to motion tracking.
Used when sequential tracking is necessary (e.g., legal proceedings following an
uprising).

üöÄ With contradiction motion tracking, Zoomout ensures that users analyze
contradictions dynamically rather than through static time-based analysis.

By maintaining both event timelines and contradiction timelines, Zoomout ensures that users
can track micro-level developments while still analyzing broader political motion.

3.2.2 The Role of Events in Contradiction Tracking
Events in Zoomout are not primary units of analysis‚Äîthey serve as entry points for
analyzing contradictions and struggles. Each event is structured to reveal the underlying
contradictions shaping political motion.

üìå Example: The NEET Protest (2021)

Structure: Brahminical Control Over Education
Contradiction: Dominant Caste vs. Oppressed Caste

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

41

Struggle: Fight for Educational Access
Event: NEET Protest 2021
Issue Card: Tracks media distortions, legal battles, political responses, and government
actions.

üî• This structuring ensures that every event is framed as part of a larger material
contradiction rather than just a one-time occurrence.

3.2.3 Event Categorization in the Database
Events in Zoomout are categorized based on their relationship to contradictions rather than
being classified solely by event type. This ensures that every recorded event is analyzed in
motion rather than treated as a static occurrence.

Event Categorization Framework
Each event is categorized based on how it interacts with contradictions, struggles, and
ruling-class responses.

Structuring Events by Contradiction Motion

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

42

Each event is assigned motion tracking attributes that determine whether it is sharpening,
neutralizing, or transforming contradictions.
1. Sharpening ‚Üí The event intensifies the contradiction, leading to heightened struggle.
2. Neutralizing ‚Üí The event is an attempt to pacify or suppress the contradiction.
3. Transforming ‚Üí The event shifts the contradiction into a new form.

üöÄ Events are stored with contradiction motion attributes, ensuring they are analyzed
as part of historical processes rather than standalone occurrences.

3.2.4 Events Sheet
The Events Sheet functions as a core dataset in Zoomout, ensuring that all recorded
developments are structured within contradiction motion tracking rather than as isolated
occurrences. Events are categorized not just by their type but by their relationship to
contradictions, struggles, and ruling-class interventions.

3.2.5 Contradiction Motion Tracking in Zoomout

1Ô∏è‚É£
Shifting from Event-Timeline Thinking to Contradiction Motion
Tracking
Events are not isolated markers of history; they are expressions of contradictions in motion.
Instead of just recording sequences of events, Zoomout captures:

‚úÖ How contradictions intensify, neutralize, or transform over time through event
interlinking.
‚úÖ How struggles develop within contradictions, mapping their trajectories.
‚úÖ How ruling-class interventions attempt to manage contradictions, including
suppression and co-optation.

This shift prevents the trap of treating events as static data points, ensuring historical
analysis remains dialectical and dynamic.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

44

2Ô∏è‚É£ How Contradictions Are Logged Over Time
Each contradiction log captures:

Intensity Level Changes ‚Üí Sharpening, Neutralizing, or Transforming
contradictions.
Associated Struggles ‚Üí (e.g., Peasant Struggles, Worker‚Äôs Movements).
Ruling-Class Responses ‚Üí (e.g., Media Manipulation, Co-optation, Repression).

üî•
Example: Contradiction Motion Tracking vs. Traditional Event
Timelines
Old Model (Event-Timeline Thinking)
2019: Factory workers go on strike.
2020: Unionization efforts increase.
2021: Government cracks down on labor protests.

New Model (Contradiction Motion Tracking in Zoomout)

üìå Contradiction: Capital vs. Labor

Sharpening ‚Üí Wage strikes intensify as inflation rises.
Struggle Intensification ‚Üí Unions gain mass support.
Ruling-Class Response ‚Üí State deploys police to suppress organizing efforts.

üöÄ This restructuring ensures contradictions‚Äînot isolated events‚Äîdrive analysis.
3.2.5.1 Event Updates and Contradiction Motion Tracking
Event updates are tracked dynamically using parent_id and update_id fields, ensuring event
timelines accurately reflect contradiction motion. This enables:
Non-linear yet coherent sequencing of events, capturing shifts in contradictions over
time.
Correct linkage of events to their originating contradiction, preserving analytical
depth.
Real-time updating of contradiction motion, enhancing historical accuracy.

Data Optimization for Event Retrieval

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

45

To maximize efficiency, Zoomout prioritizes three key retrieval components:

‚úÖ Issue Timeline Events ‚Üí Fetches all updates linked to a given parent event.
‚úÖ Stances Section ‚Üí Dynamically pulls in stance-revealing events.
‚úÖ Contradiction Motion Logs ‚Üí Tracks contradiction-level transformations across events.
3.2.5.2 Refining Contradiction Motion Tracking

üöÄ Contradiction motion tracking must be precise, avoiding false linkages while

capturing real shifts in struggle. To refine tracking, Zoomout employs the following:

üîç 1. Intensity-Level Categorization for Contradictions

Each contradiction is dynamically categorized based on motion intensity:
Latent ‚Üí The contradiction exists but has no active struggle.
Developing ‚Üí Struggles are emerging but not yet defining political reality.
Sharp ‚Üí The contradiction has reached mass political significance.
Explosive ‚Üí The contradiction is driving upheaval and restructuring forces.

üìå Example:

Before: ‚ÄúLabor unions protested wage cuts.‚Äù
After: ‚ÄúCapital vs. Labor contradiction moved from ‚ÄòDeveloping‚Äô to ‚ÄòSharp‚Äô as mass
strikes spread.‚Äù

‚öñ 2. Filtering Out Superficial Contradiction Shifts

Not every event constitutes a meaningful shift in contradiction motion. Zoomout
distinguishes:

‚úÖ Structural Shifts (Real Motion) ‚Üí When an event materially alters contradiction
trajectory.
‚ùå Incidental Events (Noise) ‚Üí Events that may appear linked but do not shift
contradiction intensity.
üìå Example:
Structural Shift: A worker uprising forces national labor reforms ‚Üí Contradiction
Motion Captured.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

46

Incidental Event: A union leader gives a speech with no direct impact ‚Üí Logged as an
event, but not a contradiction motion shift.

üîÑ 3. Handling Multi-Contradiction Interactions

Many events impact multiple contradictions simultaneously. Zoomout applies:
Primary Contradiction Assignment ‚Üí The main contradiction being sharpened.
Linked Contradictions ‚Üí Other contradictions influenced, but not primary.

üìå Example: Anti-Imperialist Struggle & National Bourgeoisie

Primary Contradiction ‚Üí Imperialism vs. National Liberation.
Linked Contradiction ‚Üí Capital vs. Labor (where national bourgeoisie exploits
workers).

üöÄ This ensures contradiction motion is tracked in a structured, rather than chaotic,
manner.

3.2.6 Issue Cards as the Core of Event Structuring
Overview
Issue Cards serve as the core structuring tool for tracking and analyzing developing political
issues. When an event escalates beyond a single occurrence and becomes an ongoing
contradiction in motion, it is assigned an Issue Card.
Issue Cards allow Zoomout to track event sequences historically and materially while
keeping contradictions, struggles, and stances explicitly linked to concrete events rather than
abstract categories.

Why Issue Cards Exist
Unlike one-off events, political issues develop over time through multiple events,
interventions, and counteractions. These require a structured method to track:
The core contradiction driving the issue.
The key events marking its development.
The stances different entities take over time.
An Issue Card ensures that all these elements are tied together in a single dynamic structure
that updates in real-time as new events unfold.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

47

Structure of an Issue Card
Each Issue Card consists of three primary rows:

Row 1: Issue Title & Description
The Issue Card is always initiated by a main event‚Äîthe event that defines the issue.
This row provides a concise summary of the issue, outlining the contradiction it
represents.

Row 2: Event Timeline
The event timeline dynamically tracks all event updates related to the issue.
Every event linked to the Issue Card is structured using parent_id and update_id,
forming a chronological event chain.
Each event is categorized based on contradiction motion tracking, using three core
statuses:
1. Developing ‚Äì The contradiction is unfolding, but its trajectory is still uncertain.
2. Peaking ‚Äì The contradiction has reached a heightened stage of conflict.
3. Resolving ‚Äì The contradiction is stabilizing, transforming, or being suppressed.

Row 3: The Three-Column Stance Model
This row tracks stance-revealing events‚Äîevents where entities take explicit political
positions.
The structure ensures that the stance model remains event-driven rather than subjective
labeling.
The three-column layout categorizes stances in reverse chronological order under
distinct ideological tendencies.
Each column dynamically populates with Profile Pictures (PFPs) of entities that took
stances in relevant events.

Issue Cards and Core-Element Timelines
Issue Timelines, which structure the second row of an Issue Card, are a specific type of CoreElement Timeline (see Section 3.2.7). However, not all Core-Element Timelines are Issue
Timelines‚Äîevents can be tracked within Struggle Timelines, Contradiction Timelines,
Entity Timelines, and Structure Timelines, even if they do not belong to an Issue Card.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

48

üìå How Issue Cards Fit Within the Events Sheet
Issue Cards pull data directly from the Events Sheet. There is no separate Issues
Sheet‚Äîthis ensures historical consistency.
Events, not struggles, serve as the primary linking point between contradictions,
entities, and stances.
Struggles are composed of multiple Issue Cards, but each Issue Card remains linked to
a specific initiating event.

üî• Why This Structure Works

‚úÖ Prevents data duplication ‚Üí All contradiction and struggle tracking flows from events,
ensuring that Issue Cards function as structured aggregations rather than redundant records.
‚úÖ Ensures historical motion is captured dynamically ‚Üí Issue Cards track
contradictions through event timelines, but they are also mapped onto Core-Element

Timelines (Struggle, Structure, Contradiction, Entity, and Issue Timelines) to contextualize
the motion of conflicts within broader historical developments.

‚úÖ Maintains analytical depth without unnecessary complexity ‚Üí Any event can escalate
into an Issue Card when needed, preserving depth while keeping the base event structure
simple. The system ensures that contradictions and struggles are not just listed, but are
tracked in their development and sharpening.

‚úÖ Clarifies the relationship between events and contradictions ‚Üí Events act as primary
data points that reveal contradictions, struggles, and structural dynamics. Instead of

contradictions being directly assigned to Issue Cards in isolation, they emerge from tracked
event timelines, making the motion of contradictions explicit and historically grounded.

‚úÖ Aligns with Core-Element Timelines ‚Üí Issue Cards function within Core-Element

Timelines, ensuring that events are tracked within their relevant struggles, contradictions,
structures, entities, and issues. This multi-dimensional approach provides a coherent
mapping of historical motion, making contradictions and struggles analyzable in their full
context.

‚úÖ Balances modularity and consistency ‚Üí The system enables flexible tracking without
losing standardization‚Äîevents are structured first, and only when an issue requires more
structured analysis does an Issue Card emerge. This prevents unnecessary clutter while
maintaining a clear analytical hierarchy.

3.2.6.1 The Issues Sheet: Tracking Developing Events

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

49

Issue Cards provide a structured framework for tracking contradictions that unfold over
time. Unlike standalone events, Issue Cards ensure that contradictions are analyzed through
their motion, capturing sharpening, neutralization, and transformation as they develop.
The Issues Sheet tracks contradictions through a three-row structure:
1. Row 1: Issue Title & Description ‚Üí Defines the core contradiction and struggle.
2. Row 2: Event Timeline ‚Üí Tracks only factual updates of the situation (parent-child
event linking).
3. Row 3: Three-Column Stance Model ‚Üí Tracks ideological stances with multiple
headlines, descriptions, and stance-revealing events.
By structuring issues in this way, Zoomout prevents historical fragmentation and ensures
that contradictions remain central to analysis.

3.2.6.2 The Struggles Sheet: Tracking Organized Political Battles
Struggles as the Aggregation of Political Battles
The Struggles Sheet consolidates political battles across multiple events into structured
categories, allowing users to track how contradictions manifest at different levels of struggle.
Struggles are organized by:
Scale: Local, national, or global.
Form: Electoral, direct action, armed struggle, legal battles, etc.
Sector: Economic, political, social, cultural.
Each struggle consists of multiple Issue Cards, ensuring that struggles are framed in terms of
contradiction motion rather than as abstract topics.

Auto-Detection of Struggles
To optimize the tracking process, the system automatically detects relevant struggles
linked to an event by mapping event_type_tag to predefined struggle categories. This
ensures:
Immediate categorization of events into ongoing struggles.
Cross-referencing between struggles and the contradictions driving them.
Dynamic tracking of how struggles evolve over time through linked events.
Users can manually adjust struggle categorizations if necessary, but the system will suggest
relevant assignments based on historical patterns and event characteristics.

Struggles as a Link Between Events and Contradictions
Since struggles emerge from contradictions, the system ensures that every tracked struggle is:
1. Rooted in material contradictions (e.g., labor disputes in a capitalist structure).

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

51

2. Connected to ruling-class responses (Legal Containment, Repression, Narrative
Manipulation, Co-optation).
3. Structured dynamically, evolving through real-time updates in the Events Sheet.
By integrating struggles into the broader contradiction framework, the Struggles Sheet
provides a historical-materialist view of political battles, ensuring that contradictions are
not only tracked but actively analyzed.

3.2.7 Core-Element Timelines: Tracking Events Across Key Dimensions
In Zoomout, events are not isolated occurrences but exist within a network of interrelated
historical, political, and social processes. To track how each event interacts with different
elements of the system, Zoomout assigns events to multiple Core-Element Timelines. These
timelines are categorized as follows:
1. Struggle Timelines ‚Äì Capturing how an event fits into broader political or social
struggles.
2. Contradiction Timelines ‚Äì Showing how an event relates to underlying material
contradictions.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

52

3. Entity Timelines ‚Äì Recording how specific entities (organizations, individuals, states)
are involved in and affected by events.
4. Structure Timelines ‚Äì Mapping how events reflect shifts in economic, political, or
social structures.
5. Issue Timelines ‚Äì Tracking the sequence of events related to a specific issue or ongoing
development.

Why Core-Element Timelines Are Necessary
Events often belong to multiple struggles, contradictions, or structural shifts
simultaneously. Assigning them to multiple Core-Element Timelines allows for a more
dialectical understanding of historical motion.
This framework ensures that events are not viewed in isolation but as nodes within
evolving historical and political processes.
Each Core-Element Timeline provides a unique analytical lens, emphasizing a
different aspect of the event‚Äôs significance.

Relation to Event Timelines and User-Mapped Timelines
Core-Element Timelines are distinct from Event Timelines, which track event updates
(via parent_id and update_id) within a singular event's development.
Core-Element Timelines also differ from User-Mapped Timelines, which allow users
to manually construct custom timelines for specific analyses.
By structuring events into these five Core-Element Timelines, Zoomout enables both macrolevel historical tracking and micro-level event analysis, ensuring that no event is treated as
an isolated occurrence.

3.2.8 Conclusion: How Event Structuring Advances Zoomout‚Äôs
Materialist Ontology

üî• Why Zoomout‚Äôs Event Structuring is Revolutionary:
‚úÖ Events are no longer treated as isolated incidents‚Äîthey are structured within
contradictions and struggles.
‚úÖ Issue Cards track event evolution, ensuring long-term contradiction analysis.
‚úÖ Event Timelines prevent historical erasure by capturing ruling-class responses.
‚úÖ The database enables real-time contradiction tracking rather than static event
logging.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

53

üöÄ With this structuring in place, Zoomout ensures that event analysis serves the
revolutionary purpose of exposing contradictions, tracking political motion, and
sharpening struggle.

3.3 Contradiction Structuring for Dynamic Analysis
3.3.1 Foundational Principles of Contradiction Structuring
Contradiction Structuring is distinct from Contradiction Motion. While motion refers to
how contradictions shift in response to events, structuring refers to the systematic mapping
of contradictions within historical processes.
Zoomout ensures contradictions are structured dialectically‚Äîmapped within their historical
and material context rather than treated as static categories.
Each contradiction is structured based on:
Material Basis: The economic, political, and social structures that give rise to the
contradiction.
Historical Development: The historical trajectory of this contradiction.
Struggle Dynamics: The forces engaged in struggle within the contradiction.
Linkages to Other Contradictions: Whether this contradiction is principal or
secondary, and how it interacts with others.

3.3.2 Contradiction Categorization Framework
Contradictions in Zoomout are categorized hierarchically to reflect their role in historical
motion:

üî¥ Principal Contradiction ‚Üí The defining contradiction of a given period that shapes all
other struggles.
üü° Secondary Contradictions ‚Üí Significant contradictions that influence struggle but do
not determine the overall historical trajectory.
‚ö™ Latent Contradictions ‚Üí Contradictions that exist but have not yet become sites of
active struggle.
Example:
In a colonial context, the contradiction between imperialism and national liberation
is the principal contradiction.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

54

The contradiction between capital and labor may be secondary if the national
bourgeoisie aligns with the working class against imperialism.

3.3.3 Tracking Contradiction Development and Shifts
Contradictions are not static‚Äîthey shift as historical conditions change.
A secondary contradiction can become principal if its intensity increases.
Example: A labor struggle may move from secondary to principal if an economic crisis
sharpens class contradictions.
Zoomout tracks these shifts dynamically, ensuring contradiction structuring adapts
to material conditions.

3.3.4 Operational Mechanisms of Contradiction Structuring in Zoomout
To maintain materialist rigor, Zoomout applies contradiction structuring systematically:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Every Event Logged Must Be Mapped to a Contradiction.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Contradictions Are Continuously Updated Based on Material Developments.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Contradictions Are Linked to Theoretical Frameworks but Adapt to Real-World
Motion.

By structuring contradictions rigorously, Zoomout ensures political analysis remains
grounded in material reality rather than abstract speculation.

3.3.5 Contradiction Sheet
The Contradiction Sheet dynamically tracks contradictions as they sharpen, neutralize, or
transform over time. It is used to connect events to the structural issues they reinforce or
challenge.
Key aspects of the Contradiction Sheet:
Tracks contradiction intensity (Sharpening, Neutralizing, Transforming).
Connects contradictions to real-world events.
Classifies contradictions by type (Class, Caste, Gender, State, Geopolitical).

3.3.7 How Contradictions Are Tracked in Zoomout

1Ô∏è‚É£ Contradictions as Dynamic Motion, Not Fixed Categories

Contradictions in Zoomout are not static listings‚Äîthey are tracked dynamically as they
sharpen, neutralize, or transform.
Unlike event-based tracking, contradiction motion tracking focuses on:

‚úÖ How contradictions intensify through struggle.
‚úÖ How contradictions shift based on ruling-class interventions.
‚úÖ How contradictions connect to broader historical motion.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Tracking Contradictions Dynamically

Each contradiction is tracked based on its motion, ensuring:

‚úÖ The current intensity level is logged (Sharpening, Neutralizing, Transforming).
‚úÖ The historical trajectory of the contradiction is structured.
‚úÖ The struggle expressions that emerge from the contradiction are recorded.

Struggles: Fight for Minimum Wage, Struggle for Union Rights
Tracked Events: Nationwide General Strikes, Anti-Privatization Protests
Issue Cards: Corporate retaliation, legal battles, propaganda campaigns
Ruling-Class Response: Media reframes unions as ‚Äújob killers,‚Äù government passes
anti-labor laws.

üî• This system ensures contradictions are actively tracked‚Äînot just recorded.
3.3.8 Contradiction Intensification & Resolution
Contradictions do not remain at a fixed intensity. Zoomout tracks how contradictions sharpen
or resolve based on struggle developments and state responses.

‚úÖ Events: Temple Entry Protests, Legal Battles for Dalit Land Ownership
‚úÖ Issue Cards: Track court rulings, media distortions, government actions
üî• This structuring ensures that contradictions are at the core of all political analysis in
Zoomout.

3.3.10 Structures & Long-Term Contradiction Mapping
3.3.10.1 Introduction
Contradictions do not arise in isolation‚Äîthey emerge from deep-rooted material structures
that define the economic, political, and social conditions of a society. In Zoomout, structures
are the long-term systems that shape contradictions, determining how power, oppression,
and struggle manifest historically.

üìå Key Principles of Structures in Zoomout:
‚úÖ Structures define the material conditions from which contradictions emerge.
‚úÖ Contradictions evolve within structures but can also challenge and transform them.
‚úÖ Structures are not fixed‚Äîthey change over time through revolutionary struggle.
üöÄ By tracking structures, Zoomout ensures that contradiction analysis is grounded in
material reality, preventing idealist distortions.

3.3.10.2 Core Types of Structures in Zoomout
Structures in Zoomout are categorized based on their role in shaping contradictions.

üî• By categorizing structures this way, Zoomout ensures that contradictions are linked
to their historical and material origins.

3.3.10.3 How Structures Generate Contradictions
Every contradiction emerges from a material structure that shapes its dynamics. Zoomout
ensures that each contradiction is mapped to its structural origins, revealing the material
basis of political struggles.

üìå Example: The Contradiction Between Capital vs. Labor
‚úÖ Structure: Capitalist Industrial System
‚úÖ Contradiction: Capital vs. Labor
‚úÖ Struggles: Fight for Wage Increases, Struggle for Workplace Safety
‚úÖ Events: General Strikes, Anti-Privatization Movements
‚úÖ Issue Cards: Track corporate retaliation, union mobilization, and state interventions
üî• This structuring ensures that contradictions are not abstract categories but material
conflicts rooted in historical structures.

3.3.10.4 Long-Term Contradiction Mapping
Contradictions evolve over time, and Zoomout ensures that they are mapped dynamically
based on historical shifts in structure and struggle.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Intensification: Struggles for Temple Entry Rights, Land Redistribution emerge.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Crisis Point: The anti-caste movement escalates into mass mobilization and state
repression.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Structural Shift: Either Dalit liberation is achieved (revolutionary transformation) or
contradiction is managed through co-optation (reservation policies without structural
change).

üî• By structuring contradictions dynamically over time, Zoomout ensures that political
evolution is mapped scientifically.

3.3.10.5 Ruling-Class Strategies for Managing Structural
Contradictions
Contradictions do not develop in isolation‚Äîthe ruling class actively intervenes to shape,
suppress, or co-opt contradictions to maintain existing power structures. These
interventions are not separate metadata fields within events but are instead tracked
dynamically through contradiction-linked events.

üìå How Ruling-Class Responses Are Tracked

Rather than treating ruling-class intervention as an isolated data field, Zoomout captures
these responses through events explicitly linked to contradictions. This ensures that
ruling-class strategies are tracked in historical motion rather than as static labels.
The following ruling-class strategies are captured as contradiction-linked events:
1.

‚öñÔ∏è Legal Containment ‚Üí Using laws and institutional measures to pacify struggles
without resolving contradictions.
üìå Example: A government introduces minor "labor protections" to quell worker
protests without addressing systemic exploitation.

Tracked As: A contradiction-linked event showing legal containment as a
neutralizing action.

2.

üö® Repressive Control ‚Üí Deploying state violence, police crackdowns, and arrests to
suppress contradictions before they escalate.
üìå Example: Mass arrests of striking workers or military deployment against
indigenous land defenders.

Tracked As: A contradiction-linked event showing repression as a sharpening
action.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

61

3.

üì∞ Narrative Manipulation ‚Üí Using media, academia, and cultural discourse to shift
public perception of contradictions.
üìå Example: Media framing of anti-austerity protests as "destabilizing riots."
Tracked As: A contradiction-linked event shaping how contradictions are
ideologically neutralized or escalated.

4.

üé≠ Co-optation ‚Üí Absorbing opposition forces into ruling-class frameworks to
neutralize their revolutionary potential.
üìå Example: A radical protest movement being institutionalized into a statecontrolled NGO with funding conditions.

Tracked As: A contradiction-linked event showing a shift in contradiction motion
(neutralizing or transforming).

üìå
Contradiction-Linking as the Mechanism for Capturing RulingClass Interventions
Since ruling-class strategies evolve in response to contradiction intensification, they are
recorded as contradiction-linked events rather than as metadata fields. This approach allows
for:

‚úÖ A clear analysis of how contradictions are managed over time.
‚úÖ Historical comparisons of ruling-class tactics across different contradictions and
struggles.
‚úÖ Tracking how specific contradictions are sharpened, neutralized, or transformed by
state and corporate interventions.

Instead of treating ruling-class responses as static labels, this method ensures that the role
of the ruling class in shaping contradictions is analyzed dynamically.

üìå Example: If a national strike leads to both state repression and legal reforms, these

responses are tracked through separate events linked to the same contradiction, allowing
Zoomout to show how different strategies were deployed simultaneously.

üìå Example of Ruling-Class Management in Action
üìå Contradiction: "Capital vs. Labor in the Gig Economy"

Legal Containment: Introduction of minor "freelancer rights" laws that fail to challenge
worker exploitation.
Repressive Control: Arrest of labor organizers attempting to unionize gig workers.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

62

Narrative Manipulation: Corporate think tanks publishing reports framing "flexible
work" as "worker empowerment."
Co-optation: Large-scale gig work protests absorbed into government-backed
committees with no real power.

üìå Contradiction: "Indigenous Land Struggles vs. Extractive Industries"

Legal Containment: Weak environmental protections that allow extractive industries to
continue land grabs.
Repressive Control: Deployment of military forces to remove indigenous land
defenders.
Narrative Manipulation: Media portraying indigenous movements as "antidevelopment" or "anti-progress."
Co-optation: Some indigenous leaders being brought into government advisory roles,
weakening movement autonomy.

3.3.10.6

1Ô∏è‚É£ Auto-Detecting Structures Involved in Events

To ensure that contradictions are mapped to their material basis, Zoomout implements an
auto-detection system for structures involved in events. This system links contradictions to
their underlying economic, political, social, and cultural structures using a rule-based and
machine-learning approach.

How It Works:
1. Event Type Mapping:
Each event type is mapped to likely structures based on historical and theoretical
analysis.
Example:
Labor strikes ‚Üí Economic Structures
Electoral fraud ‚Üí Political Structures
Religious bans ‚Üí Cultural Structures
2. Contradiction-Based Structure Suggestions:
The system suggests relevant structures based on contradiction categorization.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

63

Example:
Capital vs. Labor contradiction ‚Üí Economic structure (mode of production).
National Liberation struggles ‚Üí Political and Economic structures
(colonialism, dependency).
3. User Confirmation & Override:
Users can confirm or adjust the suggested structures for flexibility.
Structures can be manually added if they are not suggested.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Structures as Anchors for Long-Term Contradiction Analysis

Since structures define the material basis of contradictions, Zoomout uses them as anchors
for tracking contradiction motion over time.

üìå Example of Structure-Contradiction Tracking:
Economic Structure ‚Üí Capitalist Mode of Production
Contradiction: Capital vs. Labor
Motion Over Time:
Sharpening: Rise in precarious labor.
Neutralizing: Temporary wage concessions.
Transforming: Shift towards gig economy exploitation.
Political Structure ‚Üí Neocolonial State Apparatus
Contradiction: National Liberation vs. Imperialist Domination
Motion Over Time:
Sharpening: Protests against foreign military bases.
Neutralizing: Diplomatic agreements with global powers.
Transforming: Shift towards hybrid war tactics.
This ensures that contradictions are not just isolated event occurrences but are tracked
within their structural context over time.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Linking Structures to Events, Issues, and Struggles

Each event must be tagged with the relevant structures it affects, ensuring:

‚úÖ Issue Cards display the structural context behind contradictions.
project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

64

‚úÖ Struggles are linked to the material conditions they emerge from.
‚úÖ Contradiction Motion is tracked across economic, political, social, and cultural
dimensions.

This approach makes long-term contradiction mapping central to Zoomout‚Äôs analytical
framework.

3.3.10.7 Conclusion: Why Structural Analysis is Essential in Zoomout

üöÄ Contradictions do not exist in isolation‚Äîthey emerge from material structures that
shape struggle dynamics.
üöÄ Zoomout ensures that contradictions are mapped historically, showing their
evolution over time.
üöÄ Tracking ruling-class contradiction management ensures that struggles are analyzed
scientifically, preventing distortion.
üî• With this framework, Zoomout provides a revolutionary tool for understanding how
contradictions move, intensify, and shape political transformation.

3.3.11 Structures Sheet
3.3.11.1 Introduction
The Structures Sheet is a core component of Zoomout‚Äôs data model, ensuring that
contradictions are linked to their material foundations. Unlike struggles and events, which
evolve dynamically over shorter periods, structures represent the deep-rooted systems that
shape contradictions over long historical periods.

üìå Why the Structures Sheet is Critical:
‚úÖ It ensures that contradictions are not treated as abstract categories but as real
conflicts grounded in material conditions.
‚úÖ It provides a long-term historical foundation for contradiction tracking.
‚úÖ It helps users analyze how structures shape, suppress, or intensify struggles over
time.
üöÄ By integrating the Structures Sheet, Zoomout moves beyond surface-level analysis
and ensures that all contradictions are studied within their historical and materialist
context.

and material foundation.

3.3.11.3 How Structures Shape Contradictions
Every contradiction emerges from a specific structure that creates and sustains its
existence. Zoomout ensures that contradictions are always linked to the structures that
generate them.

üìå Example: The Contradiction Between Capital vs. Labor
‚úÖ Structure: Capitalist Property Relations
‚úÖ Contradiction: Capital vs. Labor
‚úÖ Struggles: Fight for Minimum Wage, Struggle for Workplace Safety
‚úÖ Events: General Strikes, Anti-Privatization Protests
‚úÖ Issue Cards: Track corporate retaliation, legal battles, and state interventions
üî• Without the Structures Sheet, contradictions would appear disconnected from their
historical roots, weakening the materialist analysis.

3.3.11.4 Tracking the Evolution of Structures

4Ô∏è‚É£ Transformation/Restoration: Either patriarchy is dismantled (revolution) or co-opted
through bourgeois feminism (restoration).
üî• This structuring ensures that political evolution is mapped scientifically rather than
as fragmented events.

3.3.11.5 Ruling-Class Management of Structures
The ruling class does not allow structures to collapse without a fight‚Äîthey actively
modify, distort, or reinforce structures to maintain power. Zoomout tracks these ruling-class
management strategies to expose how structures are sustained or adapted.

üìå Key Ruling-Class Strategies for Structure Management:
‚úÖ Legal Containment: Adjusting laws to contain contradictions without solving them.
‚úÖ Institutional Reinforcement: Strengthening ideological control through education,
media, and religion.
‚úÖ Narrative Manipulation: Shaping public perception to prevent revolutionary
consciousness.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

67

‚úÖ Repressive State Actions: Using force to suppress contradictions that threaten the
structure.
üìå Example: How the State Manages the Structure of Capitalist Property Relations
Legal Containment: Minimum wage laws introduced but kept weak.
Institutional Reinforcement: Universities promote "entrepreneurship" over class
struggle.
Narrative Manipulation: Media portrays billionaires as "self-made visionaries."
Repressive State Actions: Anti-capitalist movements are criminalized under sedition
laws.

üî• Tracking these ruling-class strategies ensures that Zoomout reveals the real
mechanisms of power, preventing reformist illusions.

3.3.11.6 Conclusion: Why the Structures Sheet is Essential in Zoomout

üöÄ Contradictions do not exist in a vacuum‚Äîthey emerge from deep-rooted material
structures.
üöÄ By linking contradictions to structures, Zoomout ensures that all analysis is
grounded in historical materialism.
üöÄ Tracking ruling-class management of structures reveals how power is maintained
and when crisis points emerge.
üî• With the Structures Sheet in place, Zoomout moves beyond surface-level event

tracking and provides a revolutionary framework for understanding how contradictions
and struggles evolve over time.

3.3.12 Power Relationships & Entity Interactions
Introduction to Power Relationships & Entity Interactions
Contradictions do not exist in isolation; they are shaped by alliances, conflicts, and power
dynamics between entities. Power relationships determine how contradictions escalate or
neutralize over time.

Key Aspects of Power Relationships:
Alliances ‚Üí Entities that align due to shared interests in a contradiction (e.g., worker
unions and student movements).

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

68

Conflicts ‚Üí Opposing forces that reinforce contradictions (e.g., landlords vs. tenant
unions).
Silent Approvals ‚Üí Entities that do not act but allow contradictions to persist (e.g.,
governments ignoring caste-based violence).

Why This Matters:
Contradictions intensify or de-escalate based on power dynamics.
Understanding these relationships allows for better contradiction mapping over
time.
It helps track shifts in political, social, and economic alliances.

3.3.13 Relationship Sheet
Introduction
The Relationship Sheet in Zoomout is designed to map direct interactions between political
entities within contradictions and struggles. Unlike Power Mapping, which tracks how
contradictions influence alliances, the Relationship Sheet focuses on documented
relationships between actors in both cooperative and antagonistic contexts.

Why Relationship Mapping is Necessary

‚úÖ Ensures political forces are tracked not just through contradictions but through
concrete interactions.
‚úÖ Distinguishes between ideological alignment (Power Mapping) and documented
interactions (Relationship Sheet).
‚úÖ Reveals shifts in alliances that indicate ruling-class adaptation strategies.
üöÄ With this refinement, the Relationship Sheet now functions as a structured political
intelligence tool, distinct from Power Mapping while remaining embedded in
contradiction tracking.

3.3.14 Ruling-Class Distortions & Contradiction Management
The ruling class does not allow contradictions to sharpen freely‚Äîthey actively manipulate,
obscure, or co-opt contradictions through state power, ideology, and economic control.

üìå Key Forms of Ruling-Class Contradiction Management:
‚úÖ Media Narratives: Shifting public perception to distort contradiction sharpening.
‚úÖ Repressive State Actions: Police crackdowns, arrests, and legal bans on struggles.
‚úÖ Policy Manipulation: Introducing reforms to temporarily defuse contradictions.
‚úÖ Co-optation Strategies: Absorbing leadership into ruling-class institutions.
üìå Example: How the State Manages the Contradiction of Patriarchy vs. Women‚Äôs
Liberation

Media shifts focus from patriarchy as structural oppression to individual "bad men."
Police criminalize feminist protests under sedition laws.

The ruling class promotes "feminism for corporate elites" while suppressing workingclass women‚Äôs struggles.

üî• By integrating contradiction management tracking, Zoomout reveals the real motion
of ruling-class political strategy.

3.3.13 Conclusion: Why Contradiction Structuring is the Heart of
Zoomout

üöÄ Contradictions are not just listed‚Äîthey are tracked dynamically based on struggle
intensity and ruling-class responses.
üöÄ Every entity in the database (structures, struggles, events, issue cards) is linked to
contradictions, ensuring materialist analysis.
üöÄ Zoomout is a revolutionary contradiction-mapping system, not a passive news
tracker.
üî• With this framework, Zoomout ensures that contradictions are the primary unit of
analysis, allowing users to see not just what is happening but why political motion
unfolds the way it does.

3.4 Stance Tracking and Political Realignments
3.4.1 Tracking Stance Evolution Over Time
Entities shift their positions as contradictions develop. These shifts may occur due to changes
in class struggle, ideological realignment, or ruling-class crisis management. Zoomout
tracks these stance evolutions to ensure that ideological shifts are not erased or
misrepresented.

Key Functions of Stance Tracking:
Captures ideological shifts over time, preventing entities from rewriting their own
history.
Reveals when contradictions force political actors to take sides.
Shows how contradictions sharpen, neutralize, or transform through stance
changes.

3.4.2 Entities Sheet
Entities play a central role in contradiction motion, and Zoomout automates their detection to
ensure accurate contradiction tracking. The Entities Sheet dynamically pulls data from event
descriptions and external sources to link political actors to relevant events.

üìå Automated Entity Detection System

üöÄ NER (Named Entity Recognition) Model Integration
Extracts organizations, movements, and state actors from event descriptions.
Cross-references entities with past event data for accuracy.

‚úÖ How It Works:
1Ô∏è‚É£
When an event is logged, the system scans its description for known entities.
2Ô∏è‚É£
The entity is matched against historical data to detect prior involvement in contradictions.
3Ô∏è‚É£
Users can confirm or modify the detected entities to refine tracking.

üìå Auto-Linking Entities to Contradictions

The system categorizes each entity based on its role within contradictions:
Primary Actors ‚Üí Directly engaged in struggles (e.g., labor unions, revolutionary
groups).
Secondary Actors ‚Üí Indirectly involved but influential (e.g., NGOs, think tanks,
academic institutions).
Ruling-Class Institutions ‚Üí State bodies, corporate networks, and media structures
that shape contradiction motion.

üî• Example:

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

72

Event: Large-scale student protests against austerity measures.
Auto-Detected Entities:
Student Federation (Primary Actor) ‚Äì Organizing the protest.
Education Ministry (Ruling-Class Institution) ‚Äì Target of demands.
Corporate Media (Narrative Manipulation) ‚Äì Framing protests as disruptive.

üìå Linking Entities to Their Historical Role in Contradictions

Zoomout tracks stance shifts over time (e.g., reformist groups radicalizing after
repression).
Ensures contradiction analysis is historically dynamic, not just event-centric.

üöÄ This automation enhances contradiction tracking, making Zoomout a powerful tool
for mapping historical motion.

3.4.3 Contradiction Weight Mapping for Entities
Entities do not just take stances‚Äîthey shape contradictions. Some entities intensify
contradictions, while others seek to neutralize them.
Each entity is mapped based on its Contradiction Weight Score (CWS), which reflects:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Direct Participation ‚Äì The entity‚Äôs material role in a contradiction (e.g., a corporation
lobbying for neoliberal reforms).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Influence Networks ‚Äì The entity‚Äôs ideological role (e.g., media narratives shaping
contradiction perception).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Historical Involvement ‚Äì The entity‚Äôs long-term impact on contradiction shifts.
Example: Contradiction Weight Mapping Table
Entity

Weight Score

Change Over Time

BJP

Fascism vs. Democracy

High

Indian National Congress

Capital vs. Labor

Medium

Declining

Reliance Industries

State vs. People

Constant

Tracking contradiction weight ensures that entities are not just categorized by stance but
by their structural role in contradictions.

3.4.4 Forecasting Contradiction Shifts Through Weight Changes
Contradiction weight mapping allows prediction of contradiction escalation or
neutralization before it manifests publicly.

Key Insights:
Entities with high contradiction weight actively drive political struggle.
Shifts in contradiction weight reveal upcoming ideological realignments.
Weight scores expose how ruling-class forces attempt to control contradictions.

Example: Contradiction Forecasting Through Entity Weight Changes
Before elections, ruling parties reduce their contradiction weight on Capital vs.
Labor by offering temporary welfare measures.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

74

Corporations intensifying privatization increase their contradiction weight,
sharpening class struggle.
Contradiction forecasting ensures that struggle is analyzed as a dynamic process shaped by
material forces rather than as a series of isolated events.

3.4.5 Stance Evolution and Contradiction Weight Mapping Integration
Contradiction weight is directly tied to stance shifts. As entities change their positions:

‚úÖ Their contradiction weight dynamically updates to reflect sharpening or neutralization.
‚úÖ The contradiction‚Äôs trajectory is recalculated based on new alignments.
‚úÖ Entities are positioned in relation to both current and historical contradiction
dynamics.

This integration ensures that contradiction tracking goes beyond event-based analysis and
moves toward structural political intelligence.

3.5 Integrating Timeline Mapping for Political Forecasting
Contradictions do not only exist in the past‚Äîthey re-emerge in cycles.
By structuring contradiction timelines, Zoomout enables:
Forecasting of when contradictions will likely sharpen again.
Analysis of ruling-class strategies for suppressing contradiction recurrence.
Strategic anticipation of revolutionary moments.
Example: Tracking Cycles of Fascist Repression in India
Period
1975

Repression Method
Emergency: Mass arrests,
censorship.

1992

Babri Masjid demolition, riots.

2014-2024

State-backed repression of dissent.

Contradiction Resurgence
Democratic forces regain ground in 1977.
Hindu nationalist forces consolidate
power.
New anti-fascist coalitions emerge.

üî• By mapping contradictions historically, Zoomout allows movements to strategize in
advance rather than react after contradictions sharpen.

Tracking contradictions across time is essential for political intelligence. The Timeline Sheet
ensures these patterns are mapped systematically.

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

75

The Timeline Sheet is not just an event organizer‚Äîit is a tool for tracking contradiction
patterns across different historical periods, allowing us to see how contradictions resurface
over time

3.5.1 Timeline Sheet
Timelines ensure that contradictions are mapped within historical struggles rather than being
treated in isolation. Events can be linked to multiple timelines based on historical, economic,
and class-based developments.
Example 1: The Indian Emergency (1975-77) is linked to both the Fascism vs.
Democracy contradiction and the State vs. People contradiction.
Example 2: The Agrarian Crisis in Punjab today connects to historical peasant
struggles from the 1980s and earlier.
Tracking contradictions over time is essential to understanding how political struggles
evolve. Some contradictions escalate rapidly, while others re-emerge cyclically over decades.
The Timeline Table helps structure these developments by:
Linking related events into historical struggles (e.g., multiple waves of farmers'
protests).
Identifying trends in contradiction sharpening or neutralization over time.
Helping users track contradiction resurgence across different eras and political
shifts.
This mapping ensures that contradictions are studied in their full historical context rather
than as isolated events.
By using timelines, Zoomout enables users to see not just isolated events, but the larger
historical forces shaping contradictions.

3.6 The Graph-Based Future of Zoomout
Why Zoomout is Transitioning to a Graph-Based Model
Tracking contradictions dynamically requires a non-linear approach. Traditional relational
databases struggle to capture the interconnected nature of contradictions, events, and
ideological shifts because they force rigid hierarchies. A graph-based model allows
contradictions to be mapped as evolving relationships rather than static classifications.
In a graph database, contradictions, entities, and events are represented as nodes, while their
relationships‚Äîalliances, conflicts, ideological shifts, escalations, and neutralizations‚Äîare
captured as edges. This shift enables:
Multi-Entity Contradictions ‚Äì A single contradiction can involve multiple entities
across different timelines.
Non-Linear Contradiction Evolution ‚Äì Contradictions don‚Äôt just move forward in a
straight line; they transform, resurface, and merge in unpredictable ways.
Real-Time Contradiction Mapping ‚Äì As new events occur, contradictions are
dynamically adjusted, sharpening, neutralizing, or transforming based on material
conditions.

How the Graph Model Enhances Contradiction Tracking
1. Contradictions are not isolated but interlinked dynamically
Example: A police crackdown on workers‚Äô protests simultaneously sharpens the
Capital vs. Labor contradiction, State vs. People contradiction, and potentially
Patriarchy vs. Gender Liberation contradiction if women workers are
disproportionately affected.
2. Entities are tracked through ideological shifts, not just events
Example: A political party that once supported agrarian movements but later allies
with corporate interests will be mapped along an ideological trajectory, not just
static positions.
3. Users can navigate contradictions as evolving networks, not separate issues

Example: A user investigating caste oppression in labor movements can trace
connections between Dalit labor struggles, agrarian contradictions, corporate
interests, and state policy changes, revealing patterns invisible in a linear model.

Example: Graph Mapping of Contradictions Over Time
Current Relational Approach (Linear & Isolated):
Event: 2020 labor strike ‚Üí Capital vs. Labor contradiction logged.
Event: 2021 police repression ‚Üí State vs. People contradiction logged.
Event: 2022 nationalist propaganda against striking workers ‚Üí Nationalism vs.
Internationalism contradiction logged.
Each event is recorded separately, and users must manually link them together to see
patterns.

Graph-Based Approach (Non-Linear & Dynamic):
2020 labor strike sharpens Capital vs. Labor contradiction.
2021 police repression strengthens link between Capital vs. Labor & State vs. People
contradictions.
2022 nationalist propaganda is detected as an ideological intervention to neutralize
contradictions.
In the graph model, contradictions self-organize as the system detects escalation patterns
across struggles.

Long-Term Vision: Graph-Based Contradiction Forecasting

project overview | ZOOMOUT V6

78

The AI-assisted contradiction tracker will identify emerging contradictions before
they reach crisis points.
The system will recognize patterns of ideological shifts, allowing users to anticipate
ruling-class countermeasures.
Users will navigate contradictions as a revolutionary battlefield, not just a dataset.

Why This Shift is Crucial for Revolutionary Intelligence
A graph-based contradiction tracker is not just a technical upgrade‚Äîit is a fundamental
shift in how contradictions are analyzed. By moving beyond rigid categories and into a
networked understanding of struggle, Zoomout will:

‚úÖ Expose contradictions hidden by ruling-class framing by linking ideological
distortions across issues.
‚úÖ Reveal contradictions before they sharpen into crises, giving movements time to
strategize.
‚úÖ Track revolutionary shifts over time, preventing historical erasure of past struggles.
